<ul>
<li><p><strong>Institute for Human and Machine Cognition</strong> (Ocala, FL)</p>
<p>Research Associate, 2012-Present</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Conversation Understanding through Belief Interpretation and Sociolinguistic Modeling (CUBISM)</u>: Co-author on an awarded proposal for the DARPA DEFT project. Constructed a system that brings together research related to dialogue understanding along participants’ internal mental content, and participants’ social roles and relationships. Managed the integration of research efforts across three geographically and institutionally distributed sites and the program sponsor. Led the design of the application program interface. Selected, installed, configured, and maintained operations infrastructure.</li>
<li><u>Moving Target Defense (Computer Network Security)</u>: Wrote a framework for generating baseline and attack traffic to evaluate Moving Target Defenses on computer networks. Developed traffic generators for benign and malicious SMTP, HTTP, FTP, IRC, DHCP, and DNS traffic. Design a network testbed and scenarios for experimentation with different configurations of network attacks and defenses.</li>
<li><u>Metaphor Extraction via Analysis of Language</u>: Integrated multiple different human language technology systems, including WordNet, VerbNet, and the Stanford Parser, in order to develop a novel method for detecting conventional metaphors in unstructured text.</li>
